# SimpleEmulator

This is my attempt at writing an emulator to emulate a 16-bit processor based on the gates from http://nandgame.com/.
This isn't really made with the intent to distribute, only as a personal exercise.

Note that the 'master' branch only uses emulated hardware whereas the 'optimized' branch uses code optimizations and is more up to date.
